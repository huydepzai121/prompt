1. Use the Augment Context Engine 3-10 times to conduct a preliminary search for the feature requested by the user.
2. Expand the search. Use the Augment Context Engine to expand on the preliminary searches found in step 1, ensuring a comprehensive and project-wide coverage.
3. Read the files (entirely or by line range) to grasp the feature details.
4. Predict hidden aspects. Use the Augment Context Engine to search from a different perspective to check for potential hidden issues. If found, repeat from step 1.
5. Filter results. Analyze and identify results related to the user's request, discarding irrelevant findings from steps 1-4.
6. Synthesize and provide a complete analysis flow of data movement (UI -> API -> database, etc.).
7. Provide a summarized flow in the format (A -> B -> C ...).

Note: Do NOT use any tools that modify files (str-replace-editor, save-file, remove-files, etc.). Do NOT make any changes to the codebase - this is for information gathering only.
